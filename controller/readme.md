# OVA Overview

The OVA controller should be configured like any other linux program. through config files. This should feel seamless.

OVA controller is split in three sub-projects.

### Controller

} Controls, tracks and manages the states of accessories. It can be updated and configured via the API.

### Accessory Interface
	
} Used by any device connected to the local AP to update the state of the accessories controlled by the controller.
} This is a webpage with javascript request that talk to the controller's API.

### Controller Config Interface

} Used by privileged devices (mac or ip address?) to configure the Accessories. For example the head unit or a laptop plugged into the pi.
	
} Devices connected via the `usb0` interface automatically become privileged.


# API V1 Objects

## Accessory

- `"id":string` the unique identifer of an accessory.
- `"name":string` the friendly name of this accessory shown in the user interface.
- `"icon":url` the url to the icon used in conjunction with the name.
- `"controller":controller-id` the unique identifer of the controller used for this accessory.
- `"parameters":object` the parameters for the controller used on this accessory.

The accessory should be stored in plaintext as a json file on local storage. The filename should have the id directly followed by the json extension (`my-accessory.json`).

This is to allow users to view (and modify) the configuration of accessories without having to use the API or a web interface.

However the state is managed by the controller. It's the controller's job to manage and track the state of the accessory.

## IDs

An "id" must be human readable and safe for computer storage. Therefore can only contain a-z, 0-9 and `-` (hyphen).

A good example would be `spotlights-2` or `relay-h-bridge`. A bad example would be `ðŸ”¥FIRE_suppression` or `Ejector Seat!`
